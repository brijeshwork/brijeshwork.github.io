    <h2>Explain PHP parameterized functions</h2>
    <p>PHP parameterized functions are functions with parameters. You can pass any number of parameters inside a function. These given parameters act as variables inside your function.

    <h2>What are the different errors in PHP?</h2>
    <p>There are 4 basically types of error.</p>
    <p>Parse Error:- Commonly caused due to syntax mistakes in codes e.g. missing semicolon, mismatch brackets.</p>
    <p>Fatal Error:- These are basically run time errors which are caused when you try to access what can't be done. E.g. accessing a dead object, or trying to use a function that hasn’t been declared.</p>
    <p>Warning Error:- These occurs when u try to include a file that is not present, or delete a file that is not on the server. This will not halt the script; it will give the notice and continue with the next line of the script.</p>
    <p>Notice Error:- These errors occurs when u try to use a variable that hasn't been declared, this will not halt the script, It will give the notice and continue with the next line of the script.</p>
    <p>E_ERROR: A fatal error that causesscript termination</p>
    <p>E_WARNING: Run-time warning thatdoes not cause script termination</p>
    <p>E_ALL: Catches all errors andwarnings</p>
    <p>E_PARSE: Compile time parse error</p>
    <p>E_NOTICE: Run time notice caused dueto error in code</p>
    <p>E_USER_WARNING: User-generatedwarning message</p>
    <p>E_USER_ERROR: User-generated errormessage</p>
    <p>E_USER_NOTICE: User-generated noticemessage</p>
    <p>E_STRICT: Run-time notices</p>
    <p>E_RECOVERABLE_ERROR: Catchable fatalerror indicating a dangerous error</p>
    <p>Three are three types of errors:1. Notices: These are trivial, non-critical errors that PHP encounters while executing a script – for example, accessing a variable that has not yet been defined. By default, such errors are not displayed to the user at all – although, as you will see, you can change this default behavior.2. Warnings: These are more serious errors – for example, attempting to include() a file which does not exist. By default, these errors are displayed to the user, but  they do not result in script termination.3. Fatal errors: These are critical errors – for example,
        instantiating an object of a non-existent class, or calling a non-existent function. These errors cause the immediate termination of the script, and PHP’s default behavior is to display them to the user when they take place

<div class="col-lg-12 ">
    <h2>What are different between require and include, include_once?</h2>
    <p>require_once() and include_once() are both the functions to include and evaluate the specified file only once. If the specified file is included previous to the present call occurrence, it will not be done again.But require() and include() will do it as many times they are asked to do.
        The include_once() statement includes and evaluates the specified file during the execution of the script. This is a behavior similar to the include() statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be included again. The major difference between include() and require() is that infailure include() produces a warning message whereas require() produces a fatal errors.
        </p>
        <p>The include() statement includes and evaluates the specified file.The documentation below also applies to require(). The two constructs are identical inevery way except how they handle
            failure. include() produces a Warning while require() results in a Fatal Error. In other words, use
            require() if you want a missing file to halt processing of the page. include() does not behave this way, the script will continue regardless. The include_once()statement includes and evaluates the
            specified file during the execution of the script. This is a behavior similar to the include() statement, with the only difference being that if the code from a file has already been included, it will not be
            included again. As the name suggests, it will be included just once.include_once()should be used in cases where the same file might be included and evaluated morethan once during a particular execution of a script, and you want to be sure that it is included exactly once to avoid problems with function redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc. require_once() should be used in cases where the same file might be included and evaluated more than once during a particular execution of a script, and you want to be sure that it is included exactly once to avoid problems with function
            redefinitions, variable value reassignments, etc

    <h2>What are the different between PHP3 and PHP4 and PHP5?</h2>
    <p>The current stable version of PHP is PHP 5.4.5 as still waiting for PHP6with unicode handlig thing
        There are lot of difference among PHP3 and PHP4 and PHP5 version of php so Difference mean oldest version have less functionality as compare to new one like
        1>PHP3 is oldest stable version and it was pure procedural language constructive like C
        2>Where as PHP4 have some OOPs concept added like class and object with new functionality
        3>and in PHP5 approximately all major oops functionality has been added along with below thing
        1. Implementation of exceptions and exception handling
        2. Type hinting which allows you to force the type of a specific argument
        3. Overloading of methods through the __call function
        4. Full constructors and destructors etc through a __constuctor and __destructor function
        5. __autoload function for dynamically including certain include files depending on the class you are trying to create.
        6 Finality : can now use the final keyword to indicate that a method cannot be overridden by a child. You can also declare an entire class as final which prevents it from having any children at all.
        7 Interfaces & Abstract Classes
        8 Passed by Reference :
        9 An __clone method if you really want to duplicate an object
        10 Numbers of Functions Deprecated or removed in PHP 5.x like ereg,ereg_replace,magic_quotes, session_register,register_globals, split(), call_user_method() etc
