                    <h2>What is Constructors and Destructors</h2>
                    <p>
                        CONSTRUCTOR : PHP allows developers to declare constructor methods for classes. Classes which have a constructor method call this method on each newly-created object, so it is suitable for any initialization that the object may need before it is used.
                        DESTRUCTORS : PHP 5 introduces a destructor concept similar to that of other object-oriented languages, such as C++. The destructor method will be called as soon as all references to a particular object are removed or when the object is explicitly destroyed or in any order in shutdown sequence.

                    <p>Garbage Collection is an automated part of PHP , If the Garbage Collection process runs, it then analyzes any files in the /tmp for any session files that have not been accessed in a certain amount of time and physically deletes them. GarbageCollection process only runs in the default session save directory, which is /tmp. If you opt to save your sessions in a different directory, the Garbage Collection processwill ignore it. the Garbage Collection process does not differentiate between which sessions belong to whom when run. This is especially important note on shared web servers. If the process is run, it deletes ALL files that have not been accessed in the directory. There are 3 PHP.ini variables, which deal with the garbage collector: PHP ini value name default session.gc_maxlifetime 1440 seconds or 24 minutes session.gc_probability 1 session.gc_divisor 100</p>

That is, a variable name which can be set and used dynamically

OO programming is also considered to be better at modeling the real world than is procedural programming. It allows for more complicated and flexible interactions. OO systems are also easier for non-technical personnel to understand and easier for them to participate in the maintenance and enhancement of a system because it appeals to natural human cognition patterns. For some systems, an OO approach can speed development time since many objects are standard across systems and can be reused. Components that manage dates, shipping, shopping carts, etc. can be purchased and easily modified for a specific system</p>

                    <h2>When and why we use static variable / functions?</h2>
                    <p>1. You use static when you want to use a method / variable that is not tied to an instance.
                        2. When you want to persistent value throughout multiple call of function.
                        3. For singleton pattern, we use static method/variable.
                        4. it is very usefull for caching if a method will be called very often and do just the same thing. For example see below

By default, cookies are created as temporary cookies which stored only in the browser’s memory. When the browser is closed, temporary cookies will be erased. You should decide when to use temporary cookies and when to use persistent cookies based on their differences:
                        *Temporary cookies can not be used for tracking long-term information.
                        *Persistent cookies can be used for tracking long-term information.
                        *Temporary cookies are safer because no programs other than the browser can access them.
                        *Persistent cookies are less secure because users can open cookie files see the cookievalues.

                    <p>What you’re really asking is whether they know how to use session_start(). It either creates or resumes a session based on an identifier that is sent to the server via a GET or POST request or a cookie. The most common use case scenario on the web is when a website won’t let you comment or post without first prompting a login. How does it know whether you’re logged in? One way would be to place a cookie in the user’s browser; on every request the cookie is sent server-side, where PHP can be used to determine which information is sent back and displayed to the client. While session_start() saves session data in files by default, it is also possible to store sessions directly in the database.</p>

                    <p>In Zend Framework, bootstrapping is the process that loads your application. This includes, but is not limited to the Session. Any resources needed by your application to process the request (the dispatch) to the application is bootstrapped/loaded/initialized before the request is fulfilled, e.g. before the controller delegates any input to the model and creates a response that is send back to the client.</p>

If any of the module name, controller name, or action are not found, it will use default values for them.
                        Zend_Controller_Dispatcher_Standard specifies index for each of the controller and action defaults and default for the module default value, but allows the developer to change the default values for each using the setDefaultController(), setDefaultAction(), and setDefaultModule() methods, respectively.

It eases installation by bringing an automated wizard, and packingthe strength and experience of PHP users into a nicely organised OOP library. PEAR also provides a command-line interface that can be used to automatically install “packages”
                        PEAR is short for “PHP Extension and Application Repository” and is pronounced just like the fruit. The purpose of PEAR is to provide:
                        A structured library of open-sourced code for PHP users
                        A system for code distribution and package maintenance

                    <p>Model-view-controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used in software engineering. Successful use of the pattern isolates business logic from user interface considerations, resulting in an application where it is easier to modify either the visual appearance of the application or the underlying business rules without affecting the other. In MVC, the model represents the information (the data) of the application; the view corresponds to elements of the user interface such as text, checkbox items, and so forth; and the controller manages the communication of data and the business rules used to manipulate the data to and from the model. WHY ITS NEEDED IS 1 Modular separation of function 2 Easier to maintain 3 View-Controller separation means:
                        A Tweaking design (HTML) without altering code B Web design staff can modify UIwithout understanding code

Static URLs are always more friendlier looking to the End Users. along with this we can use URL rewriting in adding variables [cookies] to the URL to handle the sessions</p>

                            Traditional programming has the following characteristics:Functions arewritten sequentially, so that a change in programming can affect any code that follows it. If a function is used multiple times in a system (i.e., a piece of code that manages the date), it is often simply cut and pasted into each program (i.e., a change log, order function, fulfillment system, etc). If a date change is needed (i.e., Y2K when the code needed to be changed to handle four numerical digits instead of two), all these pieces of code must be found, modified, and tested. Code(sequences of computer instructions) and data (information on which the instructions operates on) are kept separate. Multiple sets of code can access and modify one set of data. One set of code may rely on data in multiple places. Multiple sets of code and data are required to work together. Changes made to anyof the code sets and data sets can cause problems through out the system.Object-Oriented programming takes a radically different approach:Code and data are merged into one indivisible item – an object (the term “component” has also been used to describe an object.) An object is an abstraction of a set of real-world things (for example, an object may be created around “date”) The object would contain all information and
functionality for that thing (A date object it may contain labels like January, February, Tuesday, Wednesday.
It may contain functionality that manages leap years, determines if it is a business day or a holiday, etc., See Fig. 1). Ideally, information about a particular thing should reside in only one place in a system.The information within an object is encapsulated (or hidden) from the rest of the system. A system is composed of multiple objects (i.e., date function, reports, order processing, etc., See Fig 2). When one object needs information from another object, a request is sent asking for specific information. (for example, a report object may need to know what today’s date is and will send a request to the date object) These requests are called   messages and each object has an interface that manages messages. OO programming languages include features such as “class”, “instance”, “inheritance”, and “polymorphism” that increase the power andflexibility of an object

                    <h2>Quote from CGI FAQ?</h2>
                    <p>Firstly, the the HTTP protocol specifies differing usages for the two methods. GET requests should always be idempotent on the server. This means that whereas one GET request might (rarely) change some state on the Server, twoor more identical requests will have no further effect.
                        This is a theoretical point which is also good advice in practice. If a user hits “reload” on his/her browser, an identical request will be sent to the server, potentially resulting in two identical database or guestbook entries, counter increments, etc. Browsers may reload a GET URL automatically, particularly if cacheing is disabled (as is usually the case with CGI output), but will typically prompt the user before re-submitting a POST request. This means you’re far less likely to get inadvertently-repeated entries from POST.
                        GET is (in theory) the preferred method for idempotent operations, such as querying a database, though it matters little if you’re using a form. There is a further practical constraint that many systems have built-in limits to the length of a GET request they can handle: when the total size of a request (URL+params) approaches or exceeds 1Kb, you are well-advised to use POST in anycase.
                        I would prefer POST when I don’t want the status to be change when user resubmits. And GET
                        when it does not matter

We want to ensure that there is no duplication of data in a given row, and that every column stores the least amount of information possible (making the field atomic). Second Normal Form Where the First Normal Form deals with redundancy of data across a horizontal row, Second Normal Form (or 2NF) deals with redundancy of data in vertical columns. As stated earlier, the normal forms are progressive, so to achieve Second Normal Form, your tables must already be in First NormalForm.Third Normal Form I have a confession to make; I do not often use Third Normal Form. In Third Normal Form we are looking for data in our tables that is not fully dependent on the primary key, but dependent on another value in the table</p>

                        ORM is programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages.
                        Data management tasks in object-oriented programming(OOP) are typically implemented by manipulating objects that are almost always non-scalar values.For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a "Person object" with attributes/fields to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person's name,a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain "PhoneNumber objects" and so on. The address book entry is treatedas a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance)

                    <h2>What is Persistent Database Connections?</h2>
                    <p>Persistent connections are links that do not close when the execution of your script ends. When a persistent connection is requested, PHP checks if there's already an identical persistent connection (that remained open from earlier) - and if it exists, it uses it. If it does not exist, it creates the link.
                        Persistent connections are good if the overhead to create a link to your SQL serveris high. Whether or not this overhead is really high depends on many factors. Like, what kind of database it is, whether or not it sits on the same computer on which your web server sits, how loaded the machine the SQL server sits on is and so forth. The bottom line is that if that connection overhead is high, persistent connections help you considerably

Since an element of a string can only consist of one character, and the count of elements within a string starts with 0, $pear[12] sets the 13th character of the string to the letter &quot;P.&quot; Interestingly enough, we chose to set the 13th value of a string that only has five characters. While other language interpreters might have thrown an out-of-bounds index error, PHP is more forgiving and fills in the blanks with empty spaces.</p>

                    <h2>What is the maximum size of database in MySQL?</h2>
                    <p>If the operating system or filesystem places a limit on the number of files in a directory, MySQL is bound by that constraint. The efficiency of the operating systemin handling large numbers of files in a directory can place a practical limit on the  number of tables in a database. If the time required to open a file in the directory increases significantly as the number of files increases, database performance can be adversely affected.
                        The amount of available disk space limits the number of tables.
                        MySQL 3.22 had a 4GB (4 gigabyte) limit on table size. With the MyISAM storage engine in MySQL 3.23, the maximum table size was increased to 65536 terabytes (2567 1 bytes). With this larger allowed table size, the maximum effective table sizefor MySQL databases is usually determined by operating system constraints on file sizes, not by MySQL internal limits.The InnoDB storage engine maintains InnoDB tables within a tablespace that can be created from several files. This allows a table to exceed the maximum individual file size. The tablespace can include raw disk partitions, which allows extremely large tables. The maximum tablespace size is 64TB.
                        The following table lists some examples of operating system file-size limits. This is only a rough guide and is not intended to be definitive.For the most up-to-date information, be sure to check the documentation specific to your operating system.Operating System File-size LimitLinux 2.2-Intel 32-bit 2GB (LFS: 4GB)Linux 2.4+ (using ext3 filesystem) 4TB

                    <p>we can always fetch from one database and rewrite to another. here is a nice solutionof it.</p>
                    <pre>
                        $db1 = mysql_connect(“host”,”user”,”pwd”)
mysql_select_db(“db1??, $db1);
$res1 = mysql_query(“query”,$db1);$db2 = mysql_connect(“host”,”user”,”pwd”)
mysql_select_db(“db2??, $db2);
$res2 = mysql_query(“query”,$db2);At this point you can only fetch records from you previous ResultSet,
i.e $res1 “ But you cannot execute new query in $db1, even if you supply the link as because the link was overwritten by the new db.so at this point the following script will fail
$res3 = mysql_query(“query”,$db1); //this will failSo how to solve that? take a look below.
$db1 = mysql_connect(“host”,”user”,”pwd”)
mysql_select_db(“db1??, $db1);
$res1 = mysql_query(“query”,$db1);
$db2 = mysql_connect(“host”,”user”,”pwd”, true)
mysql_select_db(“db2??, $db2);
$res2 = mysql_query(“query”,$db2);
So mysql_connect has another optional boolean parameter which indicates whether alink will be created or not. as we connect to the $db2 with this optional parameter setto ‘true’, so both link will remain live.
now the following query will execute successfully.
$res3 = mysql_query(“query”,$db1);

                        The PDO ( PHP Data Objects ) extension defines a lightweight, consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP. if you are using the PDO API, you could switch the database server you used, from say PgSQL to MySQL, and only need to make minorchanges to your PHP code.
While PDO has its advantages, such as a clean, simple, portable API but its maindisadvantage is that it doesn’t allow you to use all of the advanced features that are available in the latest versions of MySQL server. For example, PDO does not allow you to use MySQL’s support for Multiple Statements.
Just need to use below code for connect mysql using PDO
try {
$dbh = new PDO(“mysql:host=$hostname;dbname=databasename”, $username, $password);

omysql_fetch_row() fetches one row of data from the result associated with the specified result identifier. The row is returned as an array. Each result column is stored in an array offset, starting at offset 0

                        1. MyISAM(The default storage engine IN MYSQL Each MyISAM table is stored on disk in three files. The files have names that begin with the table name and have an extension to indicate the file type. An .frm file stores the table format.The data file has an .MYD (MYData) extension. The index file has an .MYI (MYIndex) extension. )
                        2. InnoDB(InnoDB is a transaction-safe (ACID compliant) storage engine for MySQL that has commit, rollback, and crash-recovery capabilities to protect user data.)
                        3. Merge
                        4. Heap (MEMORY)(The MEMORY storage engine creates tables with contents that are stored in memory. Formerly, these were known as HEAP tables. MEMORY is the preferred term, although HEAP remains supported for backward compatibility. )
                        5. BDB (BerkeleyDB)(Sleepycat Software has provided MySQL with the Berkeley DB transactional storage engine. This storage engine typically is called BDB for short. BDB tables may have a greater chance of surviving crashes and are also capable of COMMIT and ROLLBACK operations on transactions)
                        6. EXAMPLE
                        7. FEDERATED (It is a storage engine that accesses data in tables of remote databases rather than in local tables. )

                    <h2>How can i retrieve values from one database server and store them other database serber using php?</h2>
                    <p>WeWe can always fetch from one database and rewrite to another. Here is a nice solution of it.
                        $db1 = mysql_connect(”host”,”user”,”pwd”);
                        mysql_select_db(”db1?, $db1);
                        $res1 = mysql_query(”query”,$db1);
                        $db2 = mysql_connect(”host”,”user”,”pwd”);
                        mysql_select_db(”db2?, $db2);
                        $res2 = mysql_query(”query”,$db2);
                        At this point you can only fetch records from you previous ResultSet, i.e $res1 – But you cannot execute new query in $db1, even if yousupply the link as because the link was overwritten by the new db.so at this point the following script will fail
                        $res3 = mysql_query(”query”,$db1); //this will failSo how to solve that? take a look below.
                        $db1 = mysql_connect(”host”,”user”,”pwd”);
                        mysql_select_db(”db1?, $db1);
                        $res1 = mysql_query(”query”,$db1);
                        $db2 = mysql_connect(”host”,”user”,”pwd”, true);
                        mysql_select_db(”db2?, $db2);$res2 = mysql_query(”query”,$db2);
                        So mysql_connect has another optional boolean parameter whichindicates whether a link will be created or not. As we connect to the $db2 with this optionalparameter set to ‘true’, so both link willremain live. Now the following query willexecute successfully.
                        $res3 = mysql_query(”query”,$db1);
                        </p>

                    <h2>What are the advantage of stored procedures, triggers indexes?</h2>
                    <p>A stored procedure is a set of SQL commands that can be compiled and stored in the server. Once this has been done, clients don’t need to keep re-issuing the entire querybut can refer to the stored procedure.
                        This provides better overall performance because the query has to be parsed onlyonce, and less information needs to be sent between the server and the client. You can also raise the conceptual level by having libraries of functions in the server. However, stored procedures of course do increase the load on the database server system, as more of
                        the work is done on the server side and less on the client (application) side.Triggers will also be implemented. A trigger is effectively a type of stored procedure, one thatis invoked when a particular event occurs.
                        For example, you can install a stored procedure that is triggered each time a record isdeleted from a transaction table and that stored procedure automatically deletes the corresponding customer from a customer table when all his transactions are deleted.Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly.Without an index, MySQL must begin with the first row and then read through the entire table to find the relevant rows. The larger the table, the more this costs. If the table has an index for the columns in question, MySQL can quickly determine the position to seek to in the middle of the data file without having to look at all the data.If a table has 1,000 rows, this is at least 100 times faster than reading sequentially. Ifyou need to access most of the rows, it is faster to read sequentially, because this minimizes disk seeks

                    <p>The normalization process involves getting our data to conform to three progressive normal forms, and a higher level of normalization cannot be achieved until the previous levels have been achieved (there are actually five normal forms, but the lasttwo are mainly academic and will not be discussed).First Normal FormThe First Normal Form (or 1NF) involves removal of redundant data from horizontal rows. We want to ensure that there is no duplication of data in a given row, and that every column stores the least amount of information possible (making the field atomic).Second Normal FormWhere the First Normal Form deals with redundancy of data across a horizontal row, Second Normal Form (or 2NF) deals with redundancy of data in vertical columns. As stated earlier, the normal forms are progressive, so to achieve Second Normal Form, your tables must already be in First Normal Form.Third Normal FormI have a confession to make; I do not often use Third Normal Form. In Third NormalForm we are looking for data in our tables that is not fully dependant on the primary key, but dependant on another value in the table</p>
