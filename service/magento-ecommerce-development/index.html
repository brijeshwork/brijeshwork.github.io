                    <p>Choosing an appropriate theme for your website is extremely acute. The reason being, customers nowadays are fond of appealing online stores.

                        Also, analysis depicts that a UI affects the customer traffic of an online store.
                        
                        Bitter but it’s true! An appealing store will encounter more customer traffic than an online store that barely uses any attractive UI elements.
                        
                        Optimized themes are very essential for the store in terms of mobile SEO and definitely speed optimization.
                        
                        Thus, experience a store which is extremely feature-rich with enhanced usability.</p>

                    <p>In a gadget driven era, we as business entrepreneurs seek to provide a better app experience to our customers. And the idea of integrating Headless PWA technology comes into play therein.

                        eCommerce has seen the upsurge in the Headless PWA, as it instigates the web compatibilities to give a native-app like experience to our customers.

                    <h2>Magento API Development</h2>
                    <p>The API development is completely based on the REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) protocols.

                        Most of the APIs are REST and quite in demand as it fetches a JSON response which is easily accessible on the websites or any device.
                        
                        Our headless developments and native applications make use of REST APIs and associated GraphQL, which is an imperative part of headless development.
                        
                        We even use REST API’s for web, eCommerce and PIM development as well.</p>
