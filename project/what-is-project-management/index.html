What is project management?
project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to meet the project requirements and achieve the desired outcome. Project management is valuable to businesses because it helps ensure that a project delivers the expected outcomes both on time and within budget.



What does a project manager do?
Hey, so we've covered what project management is and why it's important to organizations. 
Now, let's learn more about what project managers do on a day-to-day basis. 
Project managers usually follow a process that involves planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs and other factors. 
Everything they do helps make sure the project can be completed on time and on budget. 
In broad terms, a project manager also needs to make sure that the project outcome is bringing value to the company. 
A project manager can add value in many different ways. 
Whether that's creating a new service for customers or modifying an old service so it's more tailored to the customer's needs. 
No matter what the task is, a successful project will always add value. 
And it's the project manager's job to make sure that project is both valuable and successful. 
You may be asking yourself, well, if I'm a project manager, how do I add value to an organization every day? What does the day-to-day life of a project manager look like? Well, a project manager's responsibilities can vary, depending on the project, the industry, and the company they're working in. 
Are you constructing a new building? Are you project managing a renewable energy product in a startup? Or are you setting up your own event management company? Your tasks will be different in each scenario, but here's a general overview of what a typical day might look like.
A project manager's daily responsibilities always include some version of the following, planning and organizing. 
An example of that might be gathering requirements from teammates or customers. 
This means figuring out what exactly your project's trying to accomplish. 
You might have a kickoff meeting or send a survey. 
From here you may also work on creating project plans. 
Creating project plans is a key part of project management. 
It helps set the tone of the project, keeps everyone on pace and aligned, and helps move tasks along. 
Which leads me to my second point, managing tasks. 
Once the project is underway, the project manager helps manage tasks for the team members and communicates key milestones to the larger team or customers. 
This helps keep team members, and customers updated on how the project is progressing. The third piece is budgeting and controlling costs and other factors. Managing the budget and controlling costs is a common responsibility that project managers have to understand to keep the project on track and within budget. This is a full-time job because the plan you've created and managed may change causing unexpected costs to come up. And that's just to name a few. I could go on for days. But the most important thing to know about the day to day of a project manager is this: You'll use different tools, techniques and methodologies every single day. 
There's never a dull moment. Personally, my favorite part about being a project manager is that I get to watch the project's growth from start to finish. 
It's really special to create something from nothing, working from the ground up. It's a really satisfying feeling. 
As a project manager, you'll use a variety of skills every day, and a lot of these skills you might already have, and we'll discuss this more coming up. See you there.



Transferable project management skills
Welcome back. Let's get right into it and explore the variety of skills you'll use. Have you ever been tasked with planning a loved one's surprise birthday party? There's usually a lot of pressure and responsibility, but when you get it right, it feels amazing. That's still true even if there were a couple of issues. Maybe the guest of honor arrived home earlier than expected and nearly ruined the surprise. But if you made someone feel special on their birthday you probably planned a successful project. As you chose a venue, sent out invitations, and calculated your budget based on your number of guests, you were using several project management skills, like planning and organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, and controlling costs, and more. Or maybe you've never planned a party. Have you ever worked in the retail space, or in the service industry? Then you might have experience that'll translate into the project management field, too. For example, you might have been in charge of managing several employees' schedules. To do that, you had to plan and organize which employees' work styles would complement each other in a productive way. You also had to make sure that all duties and responsibilities would be covered during each shift. Plus, you had to be aware of all employees' availability. Doesn't sound familiar? Well, have you ever had to relocate for a new job and planned a big move? To successfully move all of your belongings, you may have coordinated friends and family to help. You would have had to budget and control costs for moving companies, boxes, and miscellaneous expenses. You probably packed your boxes one room at a time and clearly labeled the boxes so that you knew what each box was when you arrived at the new place. You had to manage all of these tasks simultaneously. You've likely handled several tasks like these in your lifetime. In studying project management, you'll learn to further advance and sharpen these skills so that you'll be equipped to manage even bigger, more daunting tasks. The abilities that helped you complete these past projects are a great selling point for yourself as a future project manager. So be sure to bring up these examples in job interviews to demonstrate your skills. For instance, if you're asked questions like, "Tell me about a time when you had to juggle several tasks at once", or "Tell me about a time when you had to influence a customer or a teammate." It's good to have examples that demonstrate your skills with time management and leadership in both your everyday life and previous workplaces. Are you thinking about all of the skills that you already have and can use in your future project management role? Perfect. Up next, we'll learn more about the types of project management roles that you'll be qualified for after this program. We'll also discuss how to start exploring the various job opportunities out there for you. See you soon.
